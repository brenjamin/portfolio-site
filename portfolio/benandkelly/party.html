		<h1 class="name">Jaime</h1>
		<p class="info">My newest friend, but the one I feel like I've known all my life. I’d say she’s my playmate. One I’ve been seeking for some time. There is an unspoken understanding in each of our interactions. She's charisma, humility, fun, and beauty all wrapped into one.</p>

		<h1 class="name">Bryan</h1>
		<p class="info">Also known as "The Greatest", Bryan wins two out of every three board games that he plays.  As his primary gaming partner, this can be incredibly frustrating to me, but I must say that my time with Bryan, spent gaming or otherwise, has made me a clearer and more exact thinker, and for that I am incredibly grateful.  He's the smartest guy I know with a mind as sharp as a razor - truly the greatest.  He's also got a huge heart and is a great listener, ladies.

		<p class="info">A loyal and consistently positive friend, Eric has been a great influence on my life.  The man is a healer, wise, and an all-around lover of life.  Together we are Beric, defenders and keepers of the good in the world.  We can be found jamming, laying, or playing games in the basement.</p>

		<img class="animal" src="images/falcon.png" alt="Falcon Silhouette">
		<h1 class="name">Kyle</h1>
		<p class="info">Kyle and I became quick friends in the sixth grade.  Prior to that, we were busy not knowing each other while on the same baseball team.  Also, once, before I knew him, I hurled taunts at him from the playground, while hanging on the fence of that concrete jungle - he was sitting on a school bus for a band function, wondering what this deranged kid was getting at.  Surely a strange experience for us both, but we ended becoming great friends.  A consistent confidante, fellow gamer, mentor-of-sorts, and true friend, I admire his work ethic and commitment to his goals and dreams.  Like a falcon, he has flown away, but returns for weddings and holidays.</></h1>
